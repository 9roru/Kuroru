        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <h1>Please Read Before Purchasing</h1>
        <p>By engaging in a transaction with our store, you agree to abide by the Terms of Service (TOS) outlined below. These terms are essential for entering into a sales contract with us, and all transactions are conducted under the assumption of your agreement to these terms.</p>
        <h2>1. Payment Methods</h2>
        <p>We accept payments exclusively in Crypto. No other payment methods will be accepted.</p>
        <p>1-1. You may use an exchanger at your own risk. We do not endorse or guarantee any exchanger.</p>
        <p>We accept payments through OGUSER.COM’s trusted middleman service.</p>
        <p>2-1. We may refuse to use a middleman if they are banned, not trusted on the site, or if you do not cover the middleman fee.</p>
        <h2>2. Customer Obligations</h2>
        <p>You must not engage in actions such as submitting false fraud reports, defaming our store, or otherwise interfering with our operations without factual basis.</p>
        <h2>3. Warranty and Liability</h2>
        <p>All accounts come with a login guarantee. If you are unable to access your account for any reason, you will receive a replacement or a discount on other products.</p>
        <p>3-1. The guarantee is limited to the account’s login functionality. The following are not covered:</p>
        <p>3-1-1. We are not responsible if the account is suspended. You are responsible for any violation of Twitter’s Terms of Service (TOS). Please understand that selling Twitter accounts is prohibited by Twitter’s TOS.</p>
        <p>3-1-2. We are not responsible for intentional changes to short ID handles or loss of handles due to Autoclaim/Turbo. Handle swaps are not recommended.</p>
        <p>3-1-3. We are not responsible if you change the profile picture (PFP) of a GIF profile picture, or if it is lost, including due to Twitter updates.</p>
        <p>3-1-4. We do NOT recommend changing your birth date on Twitter. If an account was created with an older birth date, it may be deemed under 13 years old and locked, even if you are 13 or older. If you change it and your account is locked, it is not covered by the guarantee.</p>
        <p>Unless there are defects in the contract or transaction issues attributable to us, we bear no responsibility for goods after delivery.</p>
        <p>If you purchase from a reseller, we have no control over the transfer of your account. If the reseller scams you, we may not be able to assist in recovering your account. Our warranty applies only to the original purchaser.</p>
        <h2>4. Our Store’s Rights</h2>
        <p>If any of the following behaviors are observed, we may, at our discretion, void the sales contract even after it has been concluded. The authority to determine whether these conditions apply rests solely with us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When smooth communication between us and you cannot be maintained, and it is deemed that the trust relationship has been compromised.</li>
            <li>When coercive actions, such as urging or pressuring us during a transaction, are observed.</li>
            <li>Any other situation where it is judged that the trust relationship between us and you has been damaged.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you violate these terms, we reserve the right to take appropriate actions, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Filing a lawsuit against you.</li>
            <li>Disclosing information to law enforcement or investigative authorities.</li>
            <li>Revoking your right to use this service.</li>
            <li>Confiscating goods delivered by us.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>5. Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>If defects in the sales contract or transaction issues are attributable to us, we will provide a refund or compensation with an equivalent product.</p>
        <p>1-1. If a product is unavailable after 24 hours, you may request a refund.</p>
        <p>All sales are final and non-refundable except as stated above.</p>
        <h2>6. Delivery and Contact</h2>
        <p>Delivery of some products may be delayed. In such cases, orders will be updated within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Telegram is the fastest way to reach us, and we typically reply within 24 hours.</p>
        <p>2-1. We will only contact you via telegram (@Ku6ru), Instagram (@villon), or OGUsers private message (https://oguser.com/12l6).</p>
        <h2>7. Supplementary Provisions</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to change these Terms of Service (TOS) at any time without prior notice.</p>
        <p>The TOS in effect at the time of your purchase will apply to your transaction.</p>
        <p>Amendments to these terms will not be applied retroactively to impose penalties on you.</p>
        <p>For customers who purchased before an amendment, the terms at the time of purchase will apply, and new terms will not take effect.</p>
        <p>“Reclamation” refers to the process by which a legitimate account owner restores their account, resulting in it being returned to them.</p>
